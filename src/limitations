Bultin function in arrays/tuples
catch cant be specific like it is in python because errors arent the same - example except ZeroDivisionError as e:
fstring there is no translation for the formatting it has in python after ":" 
imaginary numbers are not supported in js
decorators
no else in the while, for statement 
Parameters like (*args: int, **kwargs: str) are not supported 
No args after *args , def (x , y, *args, z = 7) not supported because of z 
No kwargs
